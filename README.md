### I really hate this profile type crap but I bet people are expecting me to put something here so uh.




I love game dev and unity anything that has to do with random generation is what I will be working on my main project currently is a 2d RANDOMLY GENERATED survival game.
My main language is c# becuase of unity I also dabbled at web dev for a little it was fun until I had to make the website graphical. Client server communication is a fun topic though.

Cool I give up.
